### Launch the CLI Interface

- Open [`cli.html`](https://safaritrader.github.io/js-cli/cli.html) in your web browser.
- Type commands into the input field and press **Enter** to execute them.
- Use `help` to see available commands.

### Use the Command Creator

- Open [`command_creator.html`](https://safaritrader.github.io/js-cli/command_creator.html) in your web browser.
- Use the GUI to create custom commands and sub-commands.
- Generate the JavaScript code and integrate it into your CLI.

## How to Add Custom Commands

1. **Open the Command Creator**: Use the Command Creator page to build your commands.
2. **Define Commands**: Enter command names, types, descriptions, and handler code.
3. **Generate Code**: Click **Generate Code** to create the JavaScript code for your commands.
4. **Copy and Integrate**: Copy the generated code and paste it into `js/cli.js` after the CLI initialization code.
5. **Test Your Commands**: Reload the CLI page and test your new commands.

## **Deploying to GitHub Pages**

To host your site on GitHub Pages:

1. **Push Your Code to GitHub**: Commit and push all your files to your GitHub repository.
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository's settings.
   - Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**.
   - Under **Source**, select the branch you want to use (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Click **Save**.
3. **Access Your Site**: After a few minutes, your site will be available at:
   - `https://<username>.github.io` (for user/organization sites)
   - `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>` (for project sites)

## **Final Notes**

By following this guide, you should have a fully functional GitHub Pages site hosting your CLI project and command creator. Users can interact with the CLI directly in their browsers and use the Command Creator to build and customize commands.

This project demonstrates how JavaScript and HTML can be leveraged to create interactive web-based command-line interfaces. The use of classes, event handling, and dynamic DOM manipulation showcases modern web development techniques.

Feel free to share your project with others, contribute to its development, and explore new features and enhancements!

**Enjoy building and customizing your CLI project!**
